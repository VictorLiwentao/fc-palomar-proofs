# Challenge: Meyniel's conjecture, trees are cop-win

Copied verbatim from `FormalConjectures/Wikipedia/MeynielConjecture.lean` in google-deepmind/formal-conjectures at commit `691719db2653905d5fa0775408370fb058e4c59f` (The Formal Conjectures Authors, Apache-2.0). Only imports, attributes, test lemmas and unrelated declarations are left out.
The `sorry` marks the statement to be proved; it is not a proof.

**Trees are cop-win (Nowakowski–Winkler 1983).**

Every nonempty tree has cop number `1`: a single cop, always moving towards the robber, catches
the robber on any connected acyclic graph. More generally, the cop-win graphs are exactly the
dismantlable graphs.
